					<p>Tiliadal’s symbol is a full grown tree representing stability, structure and wisdom as well as guidance and support provided by our company.  The name is a play on the founder, Rebecca Lindell’s last name, which literally means “valley of the Linden trees” in Swedish. “Tilia” is the family name of over 30 species of trees including the Linden tree, while "dal" also refers to "valley" in Swedish.</p>
