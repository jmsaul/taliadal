					<p>A text’s perceived difficulty can be affected by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Typography">typography</a>: the style and appearance of printed data. Typography determines the ease with which a reader can identify individual characters in a text, and the ease with which a reader can recognize words (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Readability">readability</a>). It can also impact the ease with which a student can understand material, particularly when that student has a reading disability. The <a href="http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/educator/additional-resources-for-educators">British Dyslexia Association (BDA)</a> provides accessibility guidelines for fonts, layouts, and headings, designed so students with reading disabilities can read more comfortably. This leads to the research question: Do typographical choices affect how all physics and astronomy students perceive physics tests and assignments, as well as how they perform on said tests and assignments?</p>

							<h4>Research Questions</h4>
							<ol>
								<li class="rsrchqstns">Do students perceive tests written using BDA guidelines as easier to understand?</li>
								<li class="rsrchqstns">Do exam questions written using BDA guidelines produce better scores as compared to unmodified questions? </li
							</ol>
							<p>For each question, we seek to answer the following sub-questions:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Does the level of the course- pre-engineering calculus-based introductory physics, introductory physics for life sciences, or low math physics for non-technical majors, affect the results of the two main research questions?</li>
								<li>If so, how does the level of the course affect the answers to the research questions? </li
							</ul>>
							<br/>
						</div>
			<h4>Proposed Study</h4>
			<p>We propose a two different research studies to start in Fall 2017 to determine if students perceive more readable questions as easier to understand (Study 1) and if students perform better on more readable exam questions (Study 2).</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Study 1: Volunteer instructors will allow their students to participate in individual clinical interviews to determine if they perceive more readable questions to be less difficult to understand. During the interviews, each student will be provided with 5-8 randomly selected questions that have either high readability or regular readability selected from an evenly divided pool of less readable and more readable questions of varying difficulties. The students will be asked to organize the questions in order of perceived difficulty and explain their reasoning. We are seeking volunteers in the Midwest so that we may travel to perform the interviews. If you are an experienced interviewer volunteering for their students, then accommodations may be made for you to conduct the interviews. If you would like to volunteer, please fill out <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/XT9DT9F">this small survey: </a></p>
			<br/>
			<p>Study 2: We are seeking instructors teaching physics at the introductory level, either preengineering calculus-based introductory physics, introductory physics for life sciences, or low math physics for non-technical majors, that are willing to participate in the study. Each instructor will need to agree to create two versions of multiple different exam questions, such that one will be unmodified and one will have increased readability. These two different versions of each question will need to appear on different versions of the exam. Each exam should contain multiple questions of each readability type. Instructors will need to provide copies of the two versions of each problem and as well as the percent of students solving the problems correctly.
