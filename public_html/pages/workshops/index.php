				<div class="left-justify">
					<h3 class="project-name">Hands-on Inquiry-based In-class Activities in Astronomy</h3>
					<p>A one to two hour-long workshop where participants are introduced to the pedagogy behind the activities and where to buy the hands-on equipment. Participants then explore the different activities.</p>
					<br/>
					<br/>
				</div>

				<div class="left-justify">
					<h3 class="project-name">Introduction to Astronomy Education Research (AER)</h3>
					<p>A two-hour workshop where AER is defined and how education research is the same as astronomy research.  The workshop proceeds by explaining the importance of research questions, followed by participants generating research questions alone and then in groups to refine their research questions. Qualitative, Quantitative and mixed methodologies are explored.</p>
					<br/>
				</div>

				<div class="left-justify">
					<h3 class="project-name">Teaching Lunar Phases by Inquiry</h3>
					<p>The purpose of this workshop is two fold: 1) To teach the concept of lunar phases and 2) To discuss the difficulties they experience in their classroom.  Instruction is based on lunar phases activities from Conceptual Activities in Astronomy by R. Lindell </p>
					<br/>
				</div>

				<div class="left-justify">
					<h3 class="project-name">Shifting the Focus:  Moving from Teacher Centered to Student-Centered Instruction
					</h3>
					<p>Multiple studies on how students learn have found the most effective innovation is switching from thinking about the best way to present course material as an instructor to how best to help students develop the skills and knowledge needed to master the course material.  The most effective reforms are those that have students working in teams on activities that help them work on the course material themselves with coaching from the instructor.  This session will discuss the process of how instructors can make this transition.</p>

In this session, we will discuss constructing learning objectives for your students, using these to develop measurable outcomes, and developing assessments to measure student success based on outcomes.  Lastly, we will discuss how to use the feedback from your assessments to improve your course outcomes in the future.
